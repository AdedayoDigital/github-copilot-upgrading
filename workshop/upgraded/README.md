# Guachi - Modern Python Version

This is an upgraded version of the Guachi configuration management system.

## Modernization Steps Completed

The following upgrades have been made to bring this legacy Python 2.5 project up to modern Python standards:

1. **Python Version Upgrade**: Updated from Python 2.5 to Python 3.6+ compatibility
   - Fixed exception handling syntax (try/except)
   - Updated imports (ConfigParser â†’ configparser)
   - Removed unicode prefixes from strings

2. **Modern Testing**:
   - Added pytest-style test files alongside the legacy unittest-style tests
   - Implemented fixtures for better test organization
   - Updated test assertions to use pytest's approach

3. **Modern Packaging**:
   - Created a pyproject.toml file for modern Python packaging
   - Updated package metadata
   - Added compatibility information for Python 3.6 through 3.12

4. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Added GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing
   - Set up multi-Python-version testing
   - Added package build and validation
